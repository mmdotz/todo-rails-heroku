#My Rails Todo App

##Description:
Creating, updating, reading and deleting tasks in a Todo list, using Ruby 2.2.3

##Note:
This app uses TASKS not TODO for a tables name, change URL accordingly

For Hard Mode: Task was changed to id 2 as 1 was deleted.

See below:

###The Following URL requirements were tested in the Rails Todo app:

`http://localhost:3000/tasks` should display all the tasks as HTML
`http://localhost:3000/tasks/new` should display an empty (new) task as HTML
`http://localhost:3000/tasks/1` should display just that single task as HTML
`http://localhost:3000/tasks/8989898` should display an error message as HTML
